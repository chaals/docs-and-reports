      Privacy is essential to the sustainable success of the advertising ecosystem. This document takes up the
      W3C TAG's <em>Privacy Principles</em> [[?Privacy-Principles]] and specialises them for advertising-related
      situations.

      This document is a draft of the Private Ad Technologies Community Group, it is intended to be contributed
      to an eventual Private Ad Technologies Working Group on the Note Track. This document does not yet
      reflect the consensus of the PATCG.

    <h2>How This Document Fits In</h2>
    <p>
      This document elaborates on the W3C TAG's <em>Privacy Principles</em> [[?Privacy-Principles]]. The latter
      document is intended to describe principles of privacy that apply across the Web, and therefore leaves the
      door open to a variety of approaches so that different use cases can be approached with some flexibility.
      This document is therefore more specific in detailing how the Web's broader privacy principles are to be
      understood in an advertising context.
    </p>

    <h2>Advertising-Specific Principles</h2>
    <section>
      <h2>Uninformed Consent is Inappropriate</h2>
      <p>
        The Privacy Principles leave mention that people can consent to some kinds of data processing, but expresses
        scepticism that consent is a valid mechanism to protect people's autonomy in a number of sitations.
      </p>
      <p>
        Indeed, when the cross-context sharing of identifiers and of behavioural data is involved, the evidence
        shows that no consent mechanism will support people in making autonomous choices.
      </p>
      <p>
        For consent to be informed, the consenting party must be clearly aware of who will use the information, and how.
        In the context of the web, this means stating in plain terms what information will be shared, how the recipients
        will be able to aggregate it (i.e. what other information do they have), and where and how the resulting aggregate
        will be used.
      </p>
      <p>
        Looking at the example of Cookie Settings, as required in Europe, it is clear that the common approach does not fulfil
        these requirements. "We need information for the functionality of the website" is insufficient because it neither
        describes what information is used, nor what it is used for. More seriously, there is generally no practicable means
        for a user to understand what the recipients of information can do with it in terms of merging it with other information.
      </p>
      <p>
        Likewise, understanding what parties hold the information is generally very difficult. While some people are aware that
        conglomerates run multiple websites, unraveling which websites are considered "the same" and which are different is too
        difficult to be practical for the general population.
